This file briefly describes each automation's purpose and behaviour.

"Daily_Routine.prj" assumes I get up at 06:30 and go to bed at 23:00, with a wind-down starting at 22:00. "Do not disturb" is on from 22:00=06:29 (to allow for an 06:30 alarm) and at 06:30 Audible is opened to spend half an hour listening to audiobooks while getting ready for the day. Then at 07:00 Google Calendar is opened for 30 seconds to show the structure of the day, then Google Tasks is open for 30 seconds to show a to-do list. Also, a vibration notification happens on the hour every hour to track the passing of time.

With "Battery.prj", your phone will announce changes to the battery level. If the battery is 100% it will ask you to disconnect it, if the battery is 20% it will ask you to plug it in, and if the battery is 10% it will beg you to save it.
